# V0.1
Initial release, the following features are available:

- **setup_cli.py** is available to setup the folder configuration file in a command line interface.
- **photo_organizer_gui.py** is available to sort photos into the set up folders.

### Known Issues

- Unhandled exception once the final image has been sorted.
- It is currently not possible to skip an image if it is already found in the destination folder, causing the program to never proceed.
- The layout is temporary and only there for testing purposes. A newer layout will be provided as an update.
